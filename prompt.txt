Create a Layakari Polyrhythm Trainer app that's used by learners of Tabla.

Core Functionality

Polyrhythm Engine: The app trains any polyrhythm defined by the user as 'N' bols over 'D' beats.
Synchronized Feedback: It provides perfectly synchronized audio and visual feedback that runs without any timing drift, thanks to the Web Audio API.

Audio Features

Three-Layer Sound:
 1. Beat: A distinct, low-frequency "thump" sound (like a kick drum) plays on every main beat.
 2. Bol: A mid-frequency, bell-like "pluck" sound plays on every bol.
 3. Subdivision: A quiet, low "tick" sound plays on every single block of the grid, allowing the user to follow the smallest rhythmic division.

Full Audio Mix Control: The UI includes three separate volume sliders for "Beat," "Bol," and "Subdivision," allowing the user to mix the sounds to focus on any part of the rhythm they choose.

Robust Mobile Audio: Includes an advanced audio-unlocking mechanism (using pointerdown and a silent "blip") to ensure sound works reliably on the first tap, even on strict mobile browsers like Chrome and Safari on iOS.

Visualizer Features

Dynamic Rhythmic Grid: A visual grid is automatically generated based on the N and D inputs.

Clear Beat Grouping: A thick blue border is drawn on the first block of each beat, clearly grouping the subdivisions into main beats.

Clear Bol Grouping: The background of the grid alternates color for each bol, making it easy to see the bol-based divisions.

Event Indicators:
 A teal dot appears on blocks where a bol lands.
A purple dot appears on blocks where a beat and a bol land together (a coincidence).

Synchronized Playhead: A bright yellow highlighted block moves across the grid, staying in perfect time with the audio.

UI/UX & Design

Fully Responsive: The layout works on all screen sizes. Controls stack vertically on mobile for easy tapping, and the visualizer grid becomes horizontally scrollable if the pattern is too wide for the screen.
Clean, Modern Interface: The app uses a dark-mode theme with Tailwind CSS and the "Inter" font for a clean, professional, and easy-to-read interface.

Precise Input: The tempo (BPM) is controlled by a number input box for exact values, defaulting to 60 BPM.

The boxes should be numbered. Repeat the numbers by the total beats. For example, with bols = 4, beats = 3, make the boxes 1 1 1 2 , 2 2 3 3 , 3 4 4 4.
